# TC-Design-Singleton-ObjectCreator

* Create implementations of the `ObjectCreator` class by making use of the singleton design pattern for each of the following archetypes:
  * Eager Initialization
  * Lazy Initialization
  * Enum Singleton
  * Bill Pugh Singleton

* Ensure each of the classes implement `ObjectCreator`.
* Ensure each of the test cases pass.
* Use the singleton pattern examples in the `io.zipcoder.zcw_demo_singleton.theory` package to guide you.
