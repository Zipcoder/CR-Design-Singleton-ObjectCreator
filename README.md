# TC-Design-Singleton-ObjectCreator

* Implement an `ObjectCreator` class which makes use of the singleton design pattern for each of these archetypes:
  * Eager Initialization
  * Lazy Initialization
  * Enum Singleton
  * Bill Pugh Singleton

* Ensure each of the classes implement `ObjectCreator`.
* Ensure each of the test cases pass.
* Use the singleton pattern examples in the `io.zipcoder.zcw_demo_singleton.theory` package to guide you.
